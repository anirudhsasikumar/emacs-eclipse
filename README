Eclipse is good. But as a die hard Emacs fan, Emacs is the IDE for me.
Install this eclipse plugin so that at the click of a button in the
toolbar, the current active file in Eclipse will open in Emacs. It
will also try to position the cursor at the same place it was in the
Eclipse window. You can configure the plug-in to execute any lisp code
after doing this.

This plug-in uses gnuserve (available at Andy Norman's site and at
meltin.net) and requires gnuclientw to be in the PATH variable. You
can also point to the full path to gnuclientw in the plugin's
preferences page.

* Installation

1. Make sure you have gnuserve installed.

2. Drop emacs-eclipse-plugin_1.2.0.jar in eclipse/plugins.jar.

3. Copy eclipse-goto-offset.el to your hard disk and load it on
startup by editing your .emacs file:

(load "~/elisp/eclipse-goto-offset.el")

The plugin will work without the second step, but character
positioning may not be accurate without it.

4. If gnuclientw is not in your PATH variable, go to the plugin
settings page in Eclipse and fill in the full absolute path to
gnuclientw.

Tested on Eclipse 3.5, 3.6; Emacs 22.1.
